# Exo_CP

Exo_CP is a project aiming to study the conception of a lower limbs exoskeleton to correct the gait of a person affected with spastic Cerebral Palsy. It was submitted to ISMR 2023, for more details please see <a href="https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/articles/bonnefoy_otmani_2023.html">this webpage</a>.


## Main codes: 
- data\_healty\_visu.py : visualise the healthy gait as recorded via MoCap
- data\_patho\_visu.py : visualise the pathological gait as recorded via MoCap
- vizoptim.py : visualise the gait as reconstructed with OCP
- optim\_exoskeleton\_healthy\_human.py : compute the torques involved in the human/exoskeleton interaction
